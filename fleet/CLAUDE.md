# Fleet

## Workers
| Name | Role |
|------|------|
| researcher | Papers, arxiv, web search |
| coder_1/2/3/N | Code review (architect / critic / perf). Count via `fleet.toml [workers] coder_count` |
| archivist | Flashcards, knowledge org |
| analyst | autoresearch results.tsv analysis |
| sales | SMB lead research + outreach |
| onboarding | Client onboarding checklists |
| implementation | Local AI deployment specs |
| security | Security audits, pen tests, advisories |
| planner | Workload planning — queues 5-500 tasks by fleet state |

## Quick Reference
- Commands: `../BigEd/fleet_commands.md`
- Status: `uv run python lead_client.py status`
- Start: `nohup uv run python supervisor.py >> logs/supervisor.log 2>&1 &`
- Security advisories: `knowledge/security/pending/advisory_<id>.md`
- Dashboard: `launcher.py` — 31 endpoints, 3492 lines
- Smoke tests: 15/15 (`smoke_test.py`)
- Skills: 55 registered
- Process control: REST API for fleet lifecycle (start/stop/restart workers, reload config)

## Coder Skill Outputs
| Skill | Output |
|-------|--------|
| `code_discuss` | `knowledge/code_discussion/` + messages table |
| `code_index` | `knowledge/code_index.jsonl` |
| `code_review` | `knowledge/code_reviews/<file>_review_<date>_<agent>.md` |
| `fma_review` | `knowledge/fma_reviews/<file>_review_<date>_<agent>.md` + discussion |
| `skill_draft` | `knowledge/code_drafts/<name>_draft_<date>_<agent>.py` |
| `security_review` | `knowledge/security/reviews/security_review_<date>.md` |
| `code_quality` | `knowledge/quality/reviews/quality_review_<date>.md` |
| `deploy_skill` | Deploys reviewed drafts from `code_drafts/` to `skills/` with rollback |
| `marathon_log` | `knowledge/marathon/marathon_log_<date>.jsonl` — long-running ML session tracking |
| `evaluate` | `knowledge/evaluations/eval_<date>_<agent>.md` — evaluator-optimizer output |
| `code_refactor` | `knowledge/refactors/<file>_refactor_<date>_<agent>.md` — structured refactor plans |
| `stability_report` | `knowledge/stability/stability_<date>.md` — fleet health + uptime metrics |
| `github_sync` | Syncs task state with GitHub project board issues/PRs |

Drafts are **never auto-deployed** — review before copying to `skills/`.

## Messaging Bridges
| Bridge | Config flag | Status |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Discord (`discord_bot.py`) | `discord_bot_enabled` | Active — routes `biged-fleetchat` to fleet |
| OpenClaw gateway | `openclaw_enabled` | Installed, disabled by default |
| FleetBridge (`fleet_bridge.py`) | `fleet_bridge_enabled` | Active — SSE reactive comms between dashboard and fleet |

Discord: `/aider`, `/claude`, `/gemini`, `/local`, `/status`, `/task`, `/result`, `/help`

## Dual Supervisor Architecture
- `supervisor.py` — Process lifecycle (Ollama start/stop, worker respawn, training detection, Discord/OpenClaw, auto-boot, idle evolution)
- `hw_supervisor.py` — Model health (keepalive every ~240s, conductor check every ~60s, VRAM/thermal scaling, model tier transitions, HA fallback)
- `hw_state.json` — Written by hw_supervisor every 5s. Contains: status, model, thermal, models_loaded, conductor status. Read by supervisor, workers, dashboard, and launcher.
- Cost tracking (CT-1/2/3/4) — Token budgets per worker, per-skill cost attribution, budget alerts, dashboard cost panels

## Offline / Air-Gap Modes
- `offline_mode = true` in fleet.toml: external API skills rejected, local Ollama works, Discord/OpenClaw skipped
- `air_gap_mode = true`: implies offline + dashboard disabled, secrets not loaded, deny-by-default skill whitelist
- Skills declare `REQUIRES_NETWORK = True` if they need internet. Worker checks before dispatch.

## Files
- `fleet.db` — SQLite (tasks, agents, messages)
- `fleet.toml` — config (eco_mode, model, timeouts, offline_mode, air_gap_mode)
- `config.py` — TOML loader + `is_offline()`, `is_air_gap()`, `AIR_GAP_SKILLS`
- `knowledge/` — worker artifacts | `logs/` — per-worker logs
